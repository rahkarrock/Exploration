Git basic commands:



1) git init (local repository will be created )
2) git clone  (cloning code/repository from remote to local system, along with cloning it will also lmake changes into  the local  git config ) 
3) will do some changes (bla bla bla)
4) Once we do some changes we will commit the changes in the local git repository 
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "valid message"
5) Till now the code is stil in the local repository, to make the changes accessible to all the user in the production or team we need to push the changes into remote repository
